# UCare

UCare is a mobile application that can connect to a router which transmits data about urine health status from a bunch of sensors attached in the bathroom. The application displays the health status and suggests steps diabetes patients can take as steps for mitigation. It also shows a list of hospitals where urinary diseases are treated.
